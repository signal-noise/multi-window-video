> Clearly describe the task, including the rationale

e.g. "Implement a phone number capture form so that users can receive SMS notifications"

> Describe the detailed feature set required

e.g. "We require a phone number field with validation only allowing UK numbers, as well as a name field and a terms checkbox. The form should only be submittable after the terms are accepted."

> Is this part of an epic? Link to it here:

e.g. "Related to #000"
